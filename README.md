### Technologies Used
* JavaScript

**Questions**

* Create a function that takes any non-negative integer as an argument and return it with its digits in descending order.
* Given a string of words, return the length of the shortest word(s). The given data will always be a string and will never be empty.
* Given a number return the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the given number.
* Write a function that takes in an array as an argument. The function moves all of the zeros to the end of the array while ensuring the order of the other elements are unchanged.

**Repl.It**

* In addition to the index.JS file, the challenge solutions can be found [here](https://repl.it/@rosendopili/Nebula-Coding-Challenge).
